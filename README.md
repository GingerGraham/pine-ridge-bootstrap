# Pine Ridge Bootstrap

This repository contains scripts designed to launch and configure other projects that may be hosted in other repos that may be private. The intention is to provide a simple way to get a project started from a public repo while keeping the actual project code private.

## Available Scripts

The following projects are currently supported:

- [Pine Ridge Podman](/pine-ridge-podman/pine-ridge-podman-bootstrap.md): A bootstrap script for configuring a Podman container host to deploy Podman quadlets in a GitOps style.
